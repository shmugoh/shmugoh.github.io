## [sv-dlp](https://github.com/juanpisss/sv-dlp)
sv-dlp is an active project that aims to provide a free, straightforward, and 
accessible solution for downloading Street View Panoramas. It also lets you interact 
with the back-end, such as retreiving metadata, and converting panoramas into shortened URLs.
sv-dlp first started as a command line interface program, but as the project matured over 
time, it became a library, opening the doors for developers to access sv-dlp's modular 
features.

What sets sv-dlp apart from its alternatives is the modular design it offers for developers 
and end-users. On the developer side, it offers support for a broad range of Street View 
services, including Apple Maps, Baidu, Bing, Google, Yandex, and Navae, and allows 
interaction with the back-end for various purposes. For the end-user, sv-dlp does 
not charge an arm and a leg for a bunch of 'extra' features packed into a 
convoluted freeware Electron disaster.

sv-dlp is also always kept up-to-date, ensuring that the unofficial API keeps working

## [dishook](https://github.com/juanpisss/dishook)
Dishook was a project that was created as a simple command line discord webhook 
executor written in Golang.

It was initially advertised for Discord webhooks, although it could theoretically 
WORK with other webhooks as long as they're /application/json types.

I made this because I wanted to mess around with my friend on our 
personal server; webhooks were too complex to run, so as any programmer
 would do, I spent an entire week working on a 1-min solution

The project was designed to be easy to use for people who have experience 
with command line interfaces and want to use Discord webhooks, but don't 
want to deal with complicated interfaces. Dishook allowed users to quickly 
and efficiently get their webhooks done without any hassle.

Although the project is no longer actively developed, it still remains a 
useful tool for those who prefer a simple and straightforward solution 
for executing Discord webhooks.
