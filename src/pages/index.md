Self-taught programmer located in Colombia, specializing in
Python, Golang, and JavaScript; including frameworks like as React Native.

I demonstrate a persistent attitude to problem-solving and perform well in
fast-paced settings. I'm dedicated on staying up-to-date with the
most recent technological trends, always ready to tackle new challenges head-on.

I put my creations on display for all to see, but when it comes to
consuming, I prefer to keep it on the down-low. I like to call it my
'secret snack stash.' But beware, that once I get obsessed with
something, there's no turning back.

The professional focus of this website is solely on [Projects](/projects)
and [Portfolio](/portfolio). The blog has been tailored-down to align with
the preferences of my online audience. However, you are welcome to explore
the [Blog](/posts) as well if you're interested!
