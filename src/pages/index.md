I'm a self-taught junior programmer with Aspergers, based in Colombia,
specializing in Python, Golang, JavaScript & TypeScript, and DevOps practices.
Beyond coding, I love digital photography and a bit of nerd blogging too!

I demonstrate a persistent attitude to problem-solving and perform well in
fast-paced settings. I'm dedicated on staying up-to-date with the
most recent technological trends, always ready to tackle new challenges head-on.

All of my creations are put on display for all to see, but when it comes to
consuming, I prefer to keep it on the down-low. I like to call it my
'secret snack stash.' But beware, that once I get obsessed with
something, there's no turning back.

The professional focus of this website is solely on [Projects](/projects)
and [Portfolio](/portfolio). The blog has been tailored-down to align with
the preferences of my online audience. However, you are welcome to explore
my [Blog](/posts) as well if you're interested!
