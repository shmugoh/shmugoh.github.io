Mediocre self-taught programmer located in Colombia, specializing in
Python, Golang, JavaScript/NodeJS, and React Native.

I demonstrate a tenacious approach to problem-solving and thrive in
dynamic environments. I'm devoted to stay up-to-date with the
most recent technological trends, always ready to
tackle new challenges head-on.

I put my creations on display for all to see, but when it comes to
consuming, I prefer to keep it on the down-low. I like to call it my
'secret snack stash.' But beware, that once I get obsessed with
something, there's no turning back.
