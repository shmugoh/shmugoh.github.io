sv-dlp is an active project that aims to provide a free, straightforward, and
accessible solution for downloading Street View Panoramas. It also lets you interact
with the back-end, such as retreiving metadata, and converting panoramas into shortened URLs.
sv-dlp first started as a command line interface program, but as the project matured over
time, it became a library, opening the doors for developers to access sv-dlp's modular
features.

What sets sv-dlp apart from its alternatives is the modular design it offers for developers
and end-users. On the developer side, it offers support for a broad range of Street View
services, including Apple Maps, Baidu, Bing, Google, Yandex, and Navae, and allows
interaction with the back-end for various purposes. For the end-user, sv-dlp does
not charge an arm and a leg for a bunch of 'extra' features packed into a
convoluted freeware Electron disaster.

sv-dlp is also always kept up-to-date, ensuring that the unofficial API keeps working
