Dishook was a project that was created as a simple command line discord webhook
executor written in Golang. It was initially advertised for Discord webhooks, although
it can technically work with other webhooks as long as they're /application/json types.

The project was designed to be easy to use for people who have experience
with command line interfaces and want to use Discord webhooks, but don't
want to deal with complicated interfaces. Dishook allows users to quickly
and efficiently get their webhooks done without any hassle. Although the
project is no longer actively developed, it still remains a
useful tool for those who prefer a simple and straightforward solution
for executing Discord webhooks.

I made this because I wanted to mess around with my friend on our
personal server; webhooks were too complex to run, so as any programmer
would do, I spent an entire week working on a 1-min solution
